Javascript
=

Javascript is the programming language commonly used for client-side (in browser) functionality. [ECMA International](http://www.ecma-international.org/default.htm) defines the ECMAScript standard (synonymous with Javascript), the most widely supported among browsers being [ECMA-262](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm).

## MVC/MVV/MV*

Model-View-Controller (and the plethora of related concepts) aim to create a pragmatic software architecture in Javascript applications.

[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) is an example application built with different MV* frameworks to introduce their respective internals.

[Backbone Fundamentals](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals) by Addy Osmani covers MV* historically as well as practically.
