HTTP
=

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the communication method for transferring data on the web. It is defined by the [http://www.ietf.org/](Internet Engineering Task Force), and the most recent spec is defined by RFCs [7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230), [7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231), [7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232), [7233](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233), [7234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234), and [7235](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235).

## Caching

Anything interacting with a web server (e.g. browsers and CDNs) does so via HTTP. HTTP response headers should be set to employ a caching strategy. See [HTTP Caching](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching) for an introduction to these techniques.
