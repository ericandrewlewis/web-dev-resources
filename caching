Caching
=

Caching means reusing previously performed tasks along the service of a request - a browser shouldn't download a CSS file that hasn't changed since the last page load, and an application shouldn't requery a database if the value hasn't changed since the last request.

See [HTTP > Caching] and [PHP > Caching].
