Caching
=

Caching is intelligent laziness. The work from previously performed tasks should be reused anywhere it can be. A browser shouldn't download a CSS file that hasn't changed since the last page load, and an application shouldn't requery a database if the value hasn't changed since the last time it checked.

See [HTTP > Caching](http.md#caching), [Web Server > Caching](web-servers.md#caching), and [PHP > Caching](php.md#caching).
