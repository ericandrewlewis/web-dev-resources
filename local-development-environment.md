Live-editing files on a server is not cool. You should work on projects in a controlled, sandboxed environment on your computer.

Use [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/) for a quick boot, minimal configuration web server with MySQL, Apache and PHP. Good for beginners.

Use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to create a virtual machine which are replicable (easy to share with a development team) and infinitely customizable.
